OpenLog is an open source project to create a simple to use data logger. 

OpenLog currently supports FAT16 and hopefully FAT32 soon.

The hardware design is released under CC-SA v3 license.
The FAT16/FAT32 firmware was originally designed by Roland Riegel and is released under the GPL v2 license.
The OpenLog firmware was modified by SparkFun Electronics.
