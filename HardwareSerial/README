For OpenLog to work under Arduino, we have to remove the normal serial interrupt that Serial.available() uses and replace it with our own RX interrupt vector in the main sketch.

To compile OpenLog you will need to install a fresh copy of Arduino somewhere. I recommend c:\Arduino-OpenLog\ so that you don't confuse the installs.

Replace the file located here:
C:\arduino-OpenLog\hardware\arduino\cores\arduino\HardwareSerial.cpp
with the HardwareSerial.cpp that you got when you did the github pull.

Remember, compiling Sketches using this special version of Arduino will drive you mad because the serial interrupts will not work.
