This readme file describes how to get the OpenLog Javelin driver to work.
Feel free to change and improve the driver but do not forget to upload the new version and make it public available so
that others can benefit from your work.


If you run into problems you can try to drop me an email at hexor@coolbox.se, maybe I can help you start off.

1.	Build the OpenLog firmware and flash the OpenLog. If you do not want to build the software you can just flash the main.hex file.
	Instructions on how to use WINAvr can be found here: http://wiki.github.com/nseidle/OpenLog/
2.	Install Javelin Stamp IDE if you have not already done that and connect OpenLog to Javelin Stamp .
3.	Copy all the folders in the "Javelin Stamp IDE" folder to the "Javelin Stamp IDE" folder created by the Javelin Stamp IDE setup software
	The files included in the folder are:
		[1] Drivers/Parallax/Javelin/Javelin Stamp IDE/Projects/OpenLog/OpenLogTest.java
		[2] Drivers/Parallax/Javelin/Javelin Stamp IDE/lib/stamp/math/Int32.java
		[3] Drivers/Parallax/Javelin/Javelin Stamp IDE/lib/stamp/peripheral/memory/openlog/OpenLog.java

		1-> OpenLog test program
		2-> Int32 class that is also available from Parallax homepage
		3-> is the actual OpenLog driver class

4.	Start Javelin Stamp IDE and open the file:
		Projects\OpenLog\OpenLogTest.java
5.	Choose Project->Make Project
6.	At the top of the OpenLogTest class, change the pin definitions so that they match your hardware setup.
		NOTE:
			OpenLog RXI must be connected to the Javelin Stamp Uart TX pin
			OpenLog TXO must be connected to the Javelin Stamp Uart RX pin
